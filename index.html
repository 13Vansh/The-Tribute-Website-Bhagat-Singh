          <h2>Shaheed (martyr) Bhagat Singh</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Bhagat Singh</strong> (27 September 1907 – 23 March 1931)
            was a charismatic Indian revolutionary who participated in the
            mistaken murder of a junior British police officer in what was to be
            retaliation for the death of an Indian nationalist.He later took
            part in a largely symbolic bombing of the Central Legislative
            Assembly in Delhi and a hunger strike in jail, which—on the back of
            sympathetic coverage in Indian-owned newspapers—turned him into a
            household name in Punjab region, and after his execution at age 23
            into a martyr and folk hero in Northern India.[9] Borrowing ideas
            from Bolshevism and anarchism he electrified a growing militancy in
            India in the 1930s, and prompted urgent introspection within the
            Indian National Congress's nonviolent but eventually successful
            campaign for India's independence.
